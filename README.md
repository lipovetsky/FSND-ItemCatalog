# FSND-Item-Catalog

Are you a fan of great literature? Philosophy? History? Western Civilization?
Boy, have I got an app for you! How about a Great Books of the Western World
digital bookshelf? One that you can add and edit and remove books and authors
from! That's right. It's all here for you. It's even got 4 authors preloaded.

You may ask yourself: how do I get it running? I'm glad you asked! I will
show you how in this Readme.

## Download the Files onto your computer

Make sure you have Git installed. That being covered, it's time to clone the
git repository to your machine. Here is the command:

`git clone https://github.com/lipovetsky/FSND-ItemCatalog.git`


## Run the database

Now that you have a copy of the program, it's time to run it! Make sure you
have Python 2 installed, and all of the accompanying software needed to run
this program. You will have to install Flask and SQL Alchemy if it's not on your
computer already. In that case, try
the following command:

`brew install flask`
`brew install sqlalchemy`


`$ psql -d news -f newsdata.sql.`

## Run the Script

The hard part is over. Now, all we have to do
is run the Python3 script! If you don't have
Python3 installed, try running this on
your terminal:

`$ brew install python3`

If that doesn't work, you need to install
homebrew. Check the following site for more:

http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install3/osx/

Now that we have Python3 installed, all we
have to do is run the following command:

`python3 news.py`

Sit back, relax, and enjoy.
The database is doing all of the heavy lifting.


## Concluding Words

This project was created as part of the Full Stack
Nanodegre for Udacity. You will learn A LOT about
SQL, should you choose to enroll. Recommended!
